About this Repository
---------------------

This is a template manual aiming to help developers when it comes to documentation.
The template provides a structure that a developer can use and
many useful snippets and examples. Documentation is written in reST format.

Documentation Structure
-----------------------

Your manual may be comprised of the whole `Documentation` folder
or just of this README file. More information about the structure
of the files can be found in `Directory and File Names`_ in "Writing
Documentation".

If you keep the Documentation folder, it should include the files Index.rst,
Includes.txt and Settings.cfg. Everything else can be changed and removed.
If you do not want to have a "Known Problems" or "Todo List" in your documentation,
remove these directories!

Just be sure to change the toctree at the bottom of file:`Documentation/Index.rst`
to include files that actually exist!

Further information
-------------------

For further information about writing TYPO3 documentation, please see

Final advice
------------

Remember: documentation is like gift wrapping, it may look superfluous,
but your friends tend to be rather disappointed when their presents
arrive in supermarket carrier bags. (Documentation-Driven Design quote)
