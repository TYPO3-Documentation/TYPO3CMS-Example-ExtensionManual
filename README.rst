TYPO3 Extension Manual Template
===============================

This is a template for a TYPO3 extension manual to help developers with
documentation. The template provides a structure that a developer can use,
as well as many useful snippets and examples.

The documentation is written in reST format and follows the general
`TYPO3 documentation standard`_ and its recommended `file structure`_.

..  Documentation is like gift wrapping, it may look superfluous,
    but your friends tend to be rather disappointed when their presents
    arrive in supermarket carrier bags.
