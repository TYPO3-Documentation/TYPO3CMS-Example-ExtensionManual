Contribute & Donate
===================

Do you want people to contribute to your extension?

Here, you can add information about conventions you use when developing.
You may want to base this on already existing conventions for the TYPO3
core and for TYPO3 documentation.

If your project is hosted on GitHub, it is a good idea to add a file:`CONTRIBUTING.rst`
file. This sample template manual has one. A link to that file will automatically
be displayed by GitHub if people enter the issues section of your project for the first time
or create an issue, so it is a good idea to include a file:`CONTRIBUTING.rst`.

The file:`CONTRIBUTING.rst` will not be displayed, when your extension is rendered on
docs.typo3.org though (because file:`CONTRIBUTING.rst` is outside of the scope of
the file:`Documentation` folder).

So, as not to create duplicate information, either use this file as main information
source about contributing and link to this page from file:`CONTRIBUTING.rst` or the other
way around.
