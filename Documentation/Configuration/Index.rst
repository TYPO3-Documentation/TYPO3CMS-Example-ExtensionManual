=============
Configuration
=============

Target group: **Developers, Integrators**

How is the extension configured? Aim to provide simple instructions detailing
how the extension is configured. Always assume that the user has no prior
experience of using your extension.

Try and provide a typical use case for your extension and detail each of the
steps required to get the extension running.


Typical Example
===============

- Do we need to include a static template?
- For example add a code snippet with comments

Minimal example of TypoScript:

- Code-blocks have support for syntax highlighting
- Use any supported language

.. code-block:: typoscript

   plugin.tx_myextension.settings {
      # configure basic email settings
      email {
         subject = Some subject
         from = someemail@example.org
      }
   }
