Users manual
============

Documentation of how to use the extension, how it works, how to apply it if it's a website plugin.

Language should be non-technical, explaining, using small examples. Don't use to many acronym unless it has been explained.

Examples: For the "News" plugin this would be a manual showing how to create the news-items, explaining the options etc.

Provide screenshots of a neutral Backend such as the Introduction Package for instance. Have in mind that the User manual could be possibly re-used in a larger documentation compilation when a company generates a documentation to its client, for example.
